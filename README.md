# Rotary Encoder Tracking System

### Overview

This project interfaces with a rotary encoder to track counts, direction, and angle using an AVR microcontroller. The system captures pulses, determines rotation direction, and calculates the current angle, providing precise rotational measurement.

### Components

- AVR Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega series)
- Rotary Encoder
- Power Supply
- Connecting Wires

### Key Functionalities

- **Pulse Counting:** The system captures pulses generated by the encoder, incrementing or decrementing the count based on rotation direction.
- **Direction Detection:** It determines the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) by analyzing the state of the encoder pins.
- **Angle Calculation:** It calculates the current angle based on the number of pulses and the encoder's resolution.

### Configuration

1. **Connect the Encoder:**
   - Connect the encoder's channel A and B outputs to the designated pins on the AVR microcontroller.

2. **Setup the Microcontroller:**
   - Configure the microcontroller's registers and enable interrupts for pulse detection.

### Usage

1. **Upload the Code:**
   - Load the provided code onto your AVR microcontroller.

2. **Monitor Outputs:**
   - Use the serial monitor to read the rotation count, direction, and calculated angle.

### Wiring

- **Channel A and B:** Connect to specific input pins on the AVR microcontroller.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the encoder and microcontroller are properly powered according to their specifications.

### Application

- **Robotics:** Precise tracking of wheel rotation and position.
- **Industrial Automation:** Monitoring machinery rotation and position.
- **User Interfaces:** Implementing rotary knobs for user input.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure the encoder is properly connected to the microcontroller.
- Verify the power supply is adequate for both the encoder and microcontroller.
- Check the serial monitor for output to debug any issues with pulse counting or direction detection.
