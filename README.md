# Encoder
This code interfaces with a rotary encoder to track counts, direction, and angle. It uses interrupts to capture pulses and determine rotation direction, updating the count accordingly. The angle is calculated based on the encoder's resolution. Ideal for precise rotational measurement in robotics and automation projects.
